### Definition:
Such a function is defined as having more than one image with respect to a given domain. A piecewise function is denoted by:
$$ y = \begin{cases} f \quad \text{dom}(f) \\
g \quad \text{dom}(g) \end{cases}$$
It should be noted that $y$ is indeed a function as long as it passes the vertical line test (or whatever the analogous test is in higher dimensions).
