### Bio:
Ã‰variste Galois was a French mathematician and political activist. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem that had been open for 350 years. (Wikipedia)

> He explained exactly *which* equations of degree 5 or higher have solutions of the traditional kind - and which do not. (Pinter, 17)
