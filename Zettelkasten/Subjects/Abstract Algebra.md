### Explanation:
This branch of mathematics deals with [[algebraic structures]] like [[groups]], [[rings]], [[fields]], and [[modules]]. It's a generalization and extension of [[elementary algebra]], focusing on the underlying algebraic structures and properties.

> "... algebra is not only a technique, it is also a branch of learning, a discipline, like calculus, physics or chemistry" (Pinter, 1)

The word algebra comes from the Arabic 'الجبر', or 'al jebr' which roughly translates to 'reunion'.

The most common algebraic laws are thus:

> Addition is commutative and associative, it has a neutral element commonly symbolized by $0$, and every element $a$ has an inverse $-a$ with respect to addition. Multiplication is associative, has a neutral element $1$, and is distributive over addition.

[[Commutativity|commutativity]]: $a * b = b * a$ 
[[associative|associativity]]: $a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c$
[[Neutral|neutrality]]: $e * a = a * e = a$ 
[[Inverse|invertability]]: $a * a^{-1} = e$
[[Distributive|Distributive]]: $a * (b \perp c) = (a * b) \perp (a * c)$

Abstraction, in it's essence, is the selection of relevant information and a discarding of the rest.
>This kind of abstraction is so natural to us as human beings that we practice it all the time without being aware of doing so. (Pinter, 16)
