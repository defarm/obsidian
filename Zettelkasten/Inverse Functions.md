### Definition:
A function $f: A \mapsto B$ is called injective (or one-to-one) if no two elements from $A$ map to the same element in $B$. $f$ is surjective (or onto) if every element in $B$ is the image of an element in $A$. If a function mapping is both injective and surjective, we call it bijective. If a function is bijective, we can say that for every element in $y$ there is a unique element in $x$ such that

$$ f(x) = y \iff f^{-1}(y) = x$$
Furthermore, we can define a function $f^{-1}(y): B \mapsto A$. We call this new function the inverse of $f$. More rigorously, we can compose both of these functions with the following result:

$$ f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \quad \forall x \in A$$
and 
$$f(f^{-1}(y))=y \quad \forall y \in B$$
