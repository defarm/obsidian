### Definition:
A graph of $f$ consists of all points $(x, y)$ such that $y = f(x)$. A graph is called symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis if whenever $(x, y)$ is on the graph, so is $(-x, y)$.  A graph is symmetric to the origin if whenever $(x,y)$ is on the graph, so is $(-x,-y)$. A function $f$ is symmetric to it's inverse with respect to the line $y=x$ since if $(x,y)$ is on the graph of $f$ then $(y,x)$ is on the graph of $f^{-1}$.

A graph in the $xy$-plane is not a function if it fails the vertical line test. If there are two or more points that lie on the same vertical line, the test fails. For every value of the independent variable (from the domain) there must exist only one dependent variable (from the range).

The $x$-coordinate (abscissa )of a point at which a graph crosses the $x$-axis is called the $x$-intercept. The $y$-coordinate (ordinate) is called the $y$-intercept.
