### Definition:
[[Functions]] which are composed of other functions are evaluated at the value of the composed function provided the following:

$f$ and $g$ are both functions
The domain of $g$ contains the range of $f$

If the above are satisfied, then we can say:
$$ \forall x_f \in \text{dom}(f) \ \exists y_f \in \text{ran}(f) = x_g \in \text{dom}(g) $$
such that
$$ g(f(x_f)) = g(y_f) = g(x_g) = y_g \in \text{ran}(g)$$
This can also be denoted as $g  \circ f$ and we say that $g$ is composed of $f$, $g$ of $f$, or $g$ circle $f$.
