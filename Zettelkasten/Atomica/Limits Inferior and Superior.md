### Definition:
Suppose $S$ is the [[set]] of all [[Subsequential Limit|Subsequential LimitS]] of a [[Sequence]] $(s_n)$. The $\lim \sup (s_n)$ is shorthand for the limit superior of $(s_n)$ and is defined as:
$$ \lim \sup (s_{n})= \sup S $$
Also, the $\lim \inf (s_n)$ is shorthand for the limit inferior of $(s_n)$ and is defined as:
$$ \lim \inf (s_{n}) = \inf S $$
