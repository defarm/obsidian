### Insight:
Let $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n$ be a [[series of functions]] that [[converges]] to a function $f$ on an interval $[a,b]$ and that for each $n$, $f'_n$ exists, is [[Continuous on a Set]] on the interval, and that the [[series of derivatives]] $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f'_n$ is uniformly convergent on the interval, then the derivative of $f$ equals the series of derivatives for every $x$ on the interval. Notationally:

$$ f'(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f'_n(x) $$
