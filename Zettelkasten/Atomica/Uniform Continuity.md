### Definition:
A [[function]] $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ is **uniformly continuous** on $D$ if for every $\epsilon>0$ there is some $\delta>0$ such that if the [[Absolute Value]] of $x-y$ is less than $\delta$, then the absolute value of the difference of the function evaluated at both points is less than $\epsilon$. Notationally:
$$ \forall \epsilon > 0\ \exists \delta > 0 : |x-y| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(y) | < \epsilon $$
### Insight:
The insight here is that the absolute value of the difference of $x$ and $y$ must be close enough together that it holds for every $\epsilon$.
