### Definition:
#### Leduc:
A function is a rule that takes an element $x$ from a domain $A$ to a range $B$. We say $f$ maps $A$ to $B$ and denote it as follows:
$$ f: A \mapsto B$$
If $f$ is a function mapping elements  $x \in A$ to $y \in B$, then we write:
$$ y = f(x) \text{ or } x \overset{f}{\mapsto} y$$
We can also call $y$ or $f(x)$ (read $f$ of $x$) the image of $f$.

#### Underdown:
A function is a mapping that associates with each object $x$ in one [[Set|set]], which we call the [[Domain (functions)|domain]], a single value $f(x)$ from a second set which we call the [[Range|range]].
