### Insight:
Let $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}f_{n}$ be a [[series]] of [[function|FUnctions]] defined on a [[set]] $S$. Suppose that each function $f_n$ is [[Continuous on a Set]] on $S$ and that the series [[converges]] [[uniform Convergence|Uniformly]] to a function $f_S$. Then $f=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}f_n$ is continuous on $S$.
