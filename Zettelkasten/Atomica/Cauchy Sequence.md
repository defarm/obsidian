### Definition:
A [[sequence]] $(s_n)$ is called a **Cauchy sequence** if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is some $N$ such that for $m$ and $n$ greater than $N$, the absolute value of the difference of $s_n$ and $s_m$ is less than $\epsilon$. Notationally:

$$ \forall \epsilon > 0,\ \exists N : m,n > N \implies |s_n-s_{m}|< \epsilon $$
