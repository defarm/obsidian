### Definition:
Let $f:D \to \mathbb{R}$ where $D$ is a [[subset]] of $\mathbb{R}$, and suppose $c \in D$. Then $f$ is **[[continuous]] at the point** $c$ if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a $\delta > 0$ such that if the [[Absolute Value]] of the [[difference]] of $x$ and $c$ is less than $\delta$ then the absolute value of the difference of $f$ evaluated at $x$ and $c$ is less than $\epsilon$. Notationally:
$$ \forall \epsilon >0,\ \exists \delta>0: |x-c| < \delta \implies |f(x)-f(c)| < \epsilon$$
### Question:
How do you go about proving these in practice?
