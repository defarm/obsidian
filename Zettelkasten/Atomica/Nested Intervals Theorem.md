### Statement:
Let $\mathscr{F} = \{A_{n}: n \in \mathbb{N}\}$  be a family of [[closed and bounded intervals]] in $\mathbb{R}$ such that $A_{n+a} \subseteq A_{n}\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then their [[intersection]] is [[non-empty]]. In formal notation:
$$ \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} A_{n}\neq \emptyset$$
