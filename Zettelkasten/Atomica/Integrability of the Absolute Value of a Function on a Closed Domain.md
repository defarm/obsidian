### Insight:
Let $f$ be [[integrable]] on $[a,b]$. Then $|f|$ is integrable on $[a,b]$ and the [[archimedian principle]] holds due to [[linearity]]. In formal notation:
$$ \left|\int_{a}^{b} f\right| \leq \int_{a}^{b} |f|$$
### Question:
What about a function whose absolute value results in a cusp, such as $\sin(x)$?
