### Definition:
Suppose $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, then a [[point]] $x \in \mathbb{R}$ is called an **accumulation point** of $S$ if for every $\epsilon>0$, every deleted [[neighborhood]] of $x$ contains a point in $S$. Additionally, the [[set]] of all accumulation points of $S$ is denoted $S'$. Notationally:
$$ \forall \epsilon > 0,\ N^*(x;\epsilon) \cap S \neq  \emptyset$$
