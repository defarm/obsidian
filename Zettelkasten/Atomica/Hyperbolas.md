### Definition
A hyperbola is the set of points in the plane such that the difference between the distances from every point on the hyperbola to two fixed points, called foci is a constant. To avoid a degenerate case, the constant difference must be smaller than the difference between the foci. Hyperbolae are not single curves; they consist of two branches which are also asymptotic

The line that contains the foci is called the focal axis.
