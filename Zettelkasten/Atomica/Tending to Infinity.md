### Definition:
Suppose $f:(a, \infty) \to \mathbb{R}$, then we say $f$ **tends to infinity** as $x \to \infty$ [[logical equivalence|if and only if]] for every $M$ in $\mathbb{R}$, there is some $N$ greater than $a$ such that if $x$ is greater than $N$, then $f(x)$ is also greater than $M$. We denote it by:
$$ \lim_{ x \to \infty } f(x) = \infty $$
Logically,
$$ \forall M \in \mathbb{R},\  \exists N > a : x > N \implies f(x) > M $$
