### Definition:
A differential equation that has a given value for some input.
### Example:
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = (6x-3) \quad y(0)=4$$$$dy = (6x-3)dx \implies \int dy = \int (6x-3) dx$$
$$ y = \frac{6x^2}{2} - 3x + c \implies y(0) = 4 = \frac{6\cdot0^2}{2} - 3(0) + c \implies 4 = c$$
$$ y = \frac{6x^2}{2} - 3x + 4 $$
