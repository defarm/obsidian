### Insight:
Let $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} f_n$ be a [[series]] of [[functions|Function]] defined on the [[interval]] $[a,b]$ and suppose that each $f_n$ is [[uniform Convergence|uniformly convergent]] to a function $f$ on the interval. Then the integral of the $f$ is the same as the series of integrals of $f_n$ on the interval. In notation:
$$ \int_{a}^{b}f(x) dx = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \int_{a}^{b} f_n(x)dx$$
