### Definition:
1. Sequences:
		A sequence $(s_n)$ is **increasing**, or non-decreasing, if:
		$$ (s_n) < (s_{n+1})\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}  $$
		It is called **decreasing**, or non-increasing, if:
		$$ (s_n) > (s_{n+1})\ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}  $$
		It is called **monotone** if it is neither increasing or decreasing.
1. Functions:
A function $f$ is increasing if:
$$ x < y \implies f(x) \leq f(y) $$
strictly increasing if:
$$ x < y \implies f(x) < f(y) $$
Decreasing if:
$$ x < y \implies f(x) \geq f(y) $$
and strictly decreasing if:
$$ x < y \implies f(x) > f(y) $$ ^9e95ed
