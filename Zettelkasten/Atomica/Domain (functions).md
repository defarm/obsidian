### Definition:
The domain of a [[Function|function]] is the [[Set|set]] of inputs accepted by the function. It is sometimes denoted $\text{dom}(f)$, where $f$ is the function. In layman's terms, it is "what $x$ can be". More precisely, given a function $f$:
$$ f: X \rightarrow Y$$
$X$ is the domain of $f$.

The set $Y$ is called the [[Range|range]], image, or co-domain of $f$.

Any function can be restricted to a subset of its domain. The restriction of $f$ to $A$ where $A \subseteq X$ is denoted $f|_A: A \rightarrow Y$.

In [[Real Analysis|real analysis]] the term [[Domain (analysis)|domain]] is used differently.
