### Definition:
###### Logic:
Given the [[Implication]] $p \implies q$, its **inverse** (or contrapositive) is:
$$ \neg p \implies \neg q $$
An implication is not [[logically equivalent]] to its inverse. The inverse of the contrapositive is called the [[converse]].

###### Algebra:
If $a$ is any [[element]] in a [[set]] $A$, and $x$ is an element in $A$ such that:
$$ a * x = e = x * a$$
then $x$ is called the **inverse** of $a$. An element's inverse may also be denoted as $a^{-1}$.
