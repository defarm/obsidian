### Motivation:
Finds the solutions or [[roots]] of the [[quadratic equation]] $ax^2+bx+c=0$.
### Formula:
$$x =\dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$
### Cases:
The [[discriminant]] $D=b^2-4ac$ has three outcomes.
1. If $D>0$, then the formula has two [[real]] solutions.
2. If $D=0$, there there is exactly one real solution.
3. If $D<0$, then there are two [[complex]] solutions and no real ones.
### Derivation:
