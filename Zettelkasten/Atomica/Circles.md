### Definition:
A circle is a [[Set]] of [[points]] in the plane that are all at a constant, positive distance from a given [[Fixed Point]]. This constant is called the [[radius]] and the given fixed point is the center. The standard equation of a circle centered at the [[origin]] is:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = a^2 $$
or equivalently,

$$ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1$$
If the center of a circle is at point $(h,k)$ , we can rewrite the equation as:

$$ (x-h)^2 +(y-k)^2 = a^2 \  \text{ or }\ \frac{(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2}{a^2}=1 $$
