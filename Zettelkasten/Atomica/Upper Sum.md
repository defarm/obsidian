### Definition:
Suppose $f$ is a [[Boundedness|Bounded]] [[Function]] on $[a,b]$ and $P = \{x_{0},\dots, x_{n}\}$ is a [[partition]] of $[a,b]$. For each $i$ in $\{1,\dots,n \}$ let
$$ M_{i}(f) = \sup\{f(x): x \in [x_{i-1},x_{i}]\}$$
We define the **upper sum** of $f$ with respect to $P$ to be:
$$ U(f,P) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} M_{i} \Delta x_{i} $$
### Question:
What does the $\Delta x_{i}$ term mean?
