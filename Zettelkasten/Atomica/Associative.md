### Definition:
For an [[Operation on a Set|operation]] to be **associative**, the order of grouped calculations, assuming we want to maintain the order of operations, does not affect the final outcome. That is, we can combine $a$ with $b$ and $c$ or $a$ and $b$ with $c$. Formally:
$$ a * (b * c)  = (a * b) * c $$
