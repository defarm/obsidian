### Definition:
The negation of a [[conjunction]] read "not $p$ and $q$"" is denoted as:
$$ \neg (p \wedge q) \iff \neg (p) \vee \neg(q)$$
This, in conjunction, with [[Negation of a disjunction|negations]] of [[Disjunction|disjunctions]] is one of [[DeMorgan's Laws]].

See this in the [[Logic Table|logic table]].
