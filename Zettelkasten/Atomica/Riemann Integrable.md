### Definition:
Let $f:[a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a [[Bounded Function|bounded]] function. If $L(f)=U(f)$, then we say that $f$ is Riemann integrable or just integrable. Furthermore,
$$ \int_{a}^{b} f = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = L(f) = U(f)$$
is called the Riemann integral or just the integral of $f$ on $[a,b]$.
