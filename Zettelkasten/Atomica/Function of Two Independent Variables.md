### Definition:
If to each element $(x,y)$ on a set $S$ in the plane there corresponds one and only one real value of $z$, then $z$ is said to be a [[Function]] of $x$ and $y$ on $S$. As in the case of [[Function of One Independent Variable]], $(x,y)$ is said to have a [[domain]] with an [[image]] $z$ on the [[Set]] $S$.

If $f(x,y)$ is such a function, defined over a domain $D$, then $f(x,a)$ on $D$ is a function of $x$ where the variable $y=a$. For example:
$$ f(x,y)=x^2y+y^2x+xy+x+y \rightarrow f(x, 2) = 2x^2+7x+ 2$$
