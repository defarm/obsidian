### Definition:
**Boolean algebra** is formally the same as the algebra of sets. It was [[George boole]] who [[Invented or Discovered?|invented]] this type of [[algebra]] in the mid-nineteenth century in England. There are two operations in this kind of algebra: union $\cup$ and intersection $\cap$. These are synonymous with addition and multiplication. That is, $A \cup B \equiv A + B$ and $A \cap B \equiv A \cdot B$. Assuming these rules, the following are true within this [[algebraic structures|structure]]:

$$ A +B  = B + A\quad \text{and} \quad A\cdot B= B \cdot A$$
$$ A \cdot (B+C) = A \cdot B + A \cdot C $$
$$ A+ \emptyset = A \quad \text{and} \quad A\cdot \emptyset = \emptyset$$
There are some truths in this type of algebra that is not conventional in the algebra of numbers:
$$ A + (B \cdot C) = (A+B)\cdot (A+C)$$
$$ A + A = A\quad \text{and}\quad A\cdot A = A$$
$$(A+B)\cdot A = A\quad \text{and} \quad (A \cdot B)+ A = A$$
This type of algebra is used in [[electrical networks]], [[computer systems]], [[codes]], and more.
