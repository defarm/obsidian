### Insight:
Let $f$ and $g$ be [[continuous]] on $[a,b]$ and [[differentiable]] on $(a,b)$. Suppose that the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ equal each other for every $x$ in $(a,b)$. Then, there exists a constant $C$ such that $f=g+C$ on $[a,b]$. In formal notation:
$$\forall x \in (a,b),\ f'(x) = g'(x) \implies \exists C:f=g+C \in [a,b]$$
