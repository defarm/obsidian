### Definition:
Given that the [[order]] of the [[natural numbers]] is $\aleph_{0}$, the order of the [[real numbers]] is $c$ and $c > \aleph_0$, is there some order $\lambda$ such that $\aleph_0 < \lambda < c$ ? This [[conjecture]] was first made by [[georg cantor]] and is known as the **continuum hypothesis**.
