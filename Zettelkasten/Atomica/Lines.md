### Definition:
The equation for a straight line in the $xy$-plane is

$$ ax + by + c = 0$$
where $a$ and $b$ are both non-zero. If the line is not vertical, then a line passing through the point $(x_1,y_1)$ with slope $m$ is defined by the point-slope formula as follows:

$$ y-y_1 = m(x-x_1) $$
Recall that the defintion of the slope is: 

$$ m = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
The slope of a vertical line is undefined. If two non-vertical lines have the same slope, they are either overlapping or  parallel. If the product of two non-vertical slopes equals -1 then the slopes are [[Perpendicular]].
