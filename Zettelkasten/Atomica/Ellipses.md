### Definition:
An ellipse is the set of points in the plane such that the sum of the distances from every [[point]] on ellipse to two fixed points, called **foci**. To avoid a degenerate case, the sum must be greater than the distance between the foci. The general equation of an ellipse centered at $(h,k)$ is given as follows:
$$ \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1 $$
The following are definitions various components for when $a>b$. The case when $b>a$ is similar.

- Foci: $(\pm c, 0)$ where $c = \sqrt{a^2-b^2}$
- Vertices: $(\pm a, 0)$ 
- Major Axis Length: $2a$
- Minor Axis Length: $2b$
- Eccentricity: $e = \dfrac{c}{a}$
