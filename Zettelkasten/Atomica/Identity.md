### Definition:
An [[element]] is called an **identity** or **neutral element** if, when combined with the element $a$, does not change $a$, for every $a$ in the set. Two notable examples are the [[Additive Identity]] and [[Multiplicative identity]]. Formally:
$$ e * a = a \quad \text{ and } \quad a * e = a$$

### Questions:
Is it the case that $e * a = a * e = a$? Yes, assuming there is an [[inverse]] element.
