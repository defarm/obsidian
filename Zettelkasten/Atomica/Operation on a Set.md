### Definition:
An **operation** on a [[set]] $A$ is, in simple terms, a way of combining two [[element|elements]] in $A$ to achieve a third element in $A$. Formally:

> An operation * on $A$ is a rule which assigns to each ordered pair $(a,b)$ of elements of $A$ exactly one element $a * b$ in $A$.

Three points that are important:
1. $a*b$ is defined for *every* pair $(a,b)$ in $A$.
2. $a*b$ is uniquely defined.
3. If $a$ and $b$ are in $A$, then $a*b$ must also be in $A$.
