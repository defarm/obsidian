### Explanation:
Conic sections are relevant to the field of [[Analytic Geometry]], the interplay between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]]. Conic sections exist in the $xy$-plane and fall under the following universal equation:
$$ Ax^2 + Bxy +Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 $$
The type of conic section is determined by the value of the [[coefficients]] in the above equation. If $B \neq 0$ then the symmetry axis of any non-line or non-circle will *not* be parallel to the coordinate axes. This can be changed by performing a [[transformation]] of the grid to align the axis of the conic such that it is parallel with the coordinate axes.
