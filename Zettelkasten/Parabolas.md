### Definition:
Let $F$ be a given fixed point and $D$ a given fixed line that doesn't contain $F$. A parabola is the set of points in the plane containing $F$ and $D$ that are equidistant from the point $F$ (focus) and the line $D$ (directrix). The axis of a parabola is the line through the focus and perpendicular to the directrix. The vertex of a parabola is the turning point, the point on the parabola's axis midway between $F$ and $D$.

The standard equation for a parabola with a vertex located at the origin is:
$$ y = \pm \dfrac{x^2}{4p} \text{ or } x = \pm \dfrac{y^2}{4p}$$
where $p$ denotes the focus and $-p$ denotes the directrix.

The definition is the line segment with endpoints on the parabola that passes through the focus, perpendicular to the axis (or, equivalently, parallel to the directrix $-p$).
