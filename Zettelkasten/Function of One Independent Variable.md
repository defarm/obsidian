### Definition:
A function is a transformation from the domain of one variable to the range of another in such a way that their relation is unique and complete. For example:
$$ \forall x \in X, \forall y \in Y;\ f(x) = y \wedge f^{-1}(y) = x$$
where $f$ is some function defined on the set $X$ with computed values on the set $Y$ and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse of $f$.

If to each value of an independent variable $x$ on a set $X$ (the set must be specified) there corresponds one and only one real value of the dependent variable $y$ on the set $Y$, then this relation is a function of $x$ on $X$.

A function is called bijective if and only if $f(f^{-1}(y)) = y$ for every element $y$ in $Y$ and $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for every $x$ in $X$.
