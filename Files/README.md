# Obsidian
This is a repository of my mathematical second brain in Obsidian. Included are my notes, sources, and Templater script.

> [!WARNING]
> [[Files/Scripts/Templater/To Do|This]] version of the JavaScript (not visible in Obsidian, but the file is located here) uses the Node.js File System (fs) module. I plan to change this to implement Templater's tp.app.vault plugin module to maintain consistency.
